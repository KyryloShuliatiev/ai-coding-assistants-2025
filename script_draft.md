## Introduction
Hello! My name is Ivan, and today Iâ€™ll tell you how artificial intelligence helps programmers write code.  
In the past, programmers had to search for answers on forums, but now AI helps them â€” right inside the code editor.

## Main Part
GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can suggest code, write tests, and even explain errors.  
Itâ€™s convenient and saves a lot of time.  
For example, Copilot offers ready-made solutions directly in Visual Studio.  
However, mistakes still happen, so the programmer must always check what the AI produces.

## Conclusion
AI is a helper, not a replacement for humans.  
It speeds up the work, but the human remains in charge.

**Question:**  
If AI can write code, who will check that itâ€™s correct?
